## Execute Queries

### Using Aggregation Pipeline: 
Aggregation queries use MongoDB's aggregation framework. These are executed using the .aggregate() function on a collection.

### Group, Sort, and Project Results: 
Aggregation pipelines often group documents, sort them based on fields, and project the necessary information..

### MapReduce Queries
MapReduce Function: MapReduce operations are more customized and can be run using map and reduce functions. These functions emit key-value pairs and aggregate them.

## Output
All Queries will show output in JSON like Format.
